## Visitor

#### 개요

one way to implement an operation that involves the objects in a complex structure is to provide logic in each of their classes to support the operation.

the visitor pattern provides an alternate way to implement such operations taht avoids complicating the classes of the objects in the structure by putting al the necessary logic in a separate class.

the visitor pattern also allows the logic to be varied bhy using different visitor classes.
